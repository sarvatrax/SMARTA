# SMARTA
 Smart Attendance through Real-Time Analysis 

 Built a facial recognition-based attendance system with age & emotion detection. Logged time-stamped entries securely using Pandas.

ðŸ”¹ What SMARTA Does:
- Uses facial recognition to automatically mark attendance.
- Integrates emotion detection to gauge classroom engagement (optional).
- Predicts approximate age to validate or enrich user data.
- Saves user roll numbers and matches identities with confidence-based verification.
- Can work in real time via webcam.
- Logs data with timestamps for accurate record keeping.

 The project folder must have:
1. "images" folder (where images are stored)
2. "ages" folder (stores predicted ages along with self-calculated median age)
3. "roll_no" folder (to store registered roll numbers)
4. "attendance.csv" file (marks attendace with date and time)
