- Uses facial recognition to automatically mark attendance.
- Integrates emotion detection to gauge classroom engagement (optional).
- Predicts approximate age to validate or enrich user data.
- Saves user roll numbers and matches identities with confidence-based verification.
- Can work in real time via webcam or saved video streams.
- Logs data with timestamps for accurate recordkeeping.
